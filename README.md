# **Ethical-Hacking-Website-Exploitation**

## **Ethical Hacking Project**
This project is designed to perform basic reconnaissance on a target website by scanning subdomains and directories to identify any potential vulnerabilities. The project is written in Python and uses the requests library to send HTTP requests and the re library to work with regular expressions.

## **Installation and Setup**
Before running the project, make sure to install Python and the requests library on your machine. You can install the library by running the following command in your terminal:
    pip install requests

To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory. The main script is test_scripts.py, which performs the subdomain and directory scanning. 

## **Usage**
To run the script, execute the following command in your terminal:
    python test_scripts.py DOMAIN_NAME
The script will then loop through all subdomains and directories listed in the input files and send HTTP requests to check for files. If a file is found, the script will add it to an output list.

## **Output**
The script will output three lists: subdomains_output, directories_output, and files_output. The subdomains_output list contains all subdomains that were found to exist on the target domain. The directories_output list contains all directories that were found to exist on the target domain. The files_output list contains all files that were found to exist on the target domain.

# **Brute force method**
## **bonus.py**
This Python code performs a brute force attack to test a login page for a given website.

The requests module is used to make HTTP requests to the login page, while itertools is used to generate all possible two-word combinations of a list of common passwords.

The url variable specifies the URL of the login page, and the username variable specifies the username to be tested.

The passwords list contains a collection of common passwords. This list can be extended to include additional common passwords if needed.

The combinations list is created by using itertools.product() to generate all possible two-word combinations of the passwords list.

The passwords list is then updated to include both the original passwords list and the combinations list.

The for loop iterates over each password in the passwords list and makes a POST request to the login page using the current username and password. If the response indicates a successful login (by checking for the presence of the text "Welcome" in the response text), the program prints a message indicating that the login was successful and the password used. If the login is unsuccessful, the program prints a message indicating that the login failed and the password used.
