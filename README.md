# **Ethical-Hacking-Website-Exploitation**

## **Ethical Hacking Project**
This project is designed to perform basic reconnaissance on a target website by scanning subdomains and directories to identify any potential vulnerabilities. The project is written in Python and uses the requests library to send HTTP requests and the re library to work with regular expressions.

## **Installation and Setup**
Before running the project, make sure to install Python and the requests library on your machine. You can install the library by running the following command in your terminal:
    pip install requests

To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory. The main script is test_scripts.py, which performs the subdomain and directory scanning. 

## **Usage**
To run the script, execute the following command in your terminal:
    python test_scripts.py DOMAIN_NAME
The script will then loop through all subdomains and directories listed in the input files and send HTTP requests to check for files. If a file is found, the script will add it to an output list.

## **Output**
The script will output three lists: subdomains_output, directories_output, and files_output. The subdomains_output list contains all subdomains that were found to exist on the target domain. The directories_output list contains all directories that were found to exist on the target domain. The files_output list contains all files that were found to exist on the target domain.
